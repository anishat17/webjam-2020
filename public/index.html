            <p>Think you know UCI's campus as well as Petr? He doesn't think so! 
                However, he's willing to give you a chance if you play a 
                game of Hide and Seek with him for five rounds. Guess the correct 
                name of the locations where Petr is hiding as many times as you can!
                Interact with the pictures by grabbing and moving to get a better idea
                of where you are. Have you got what it takes?

            <p2>Your five rounds are up! In how many places did you
                find Petr? Did you get all five locations? If you got more
                than four, congrats! You know UCI's campus as well as anybody!
                If not, be sure to explore all the places you've seen and then try
                again! ZOT! ZOT! ZOT!
